# 2026-02-21-2

- **Date**: 2026-02-21
- **Title**: Added git-workflow-guard governance skill
- **Background / Issue**: Commit policy and branch strategy rules were fragmented and needed one reusable governance source.
- **Actions / Outcome**: Added `git-workflow-guard` and updated AGENTS with Angular commit, Git Flow, and agent-specific Co-Author requirements.
- **Lessons / Refinements**: Centralizing workflow constraints in one skill reduces policy conflicts and review friction.
