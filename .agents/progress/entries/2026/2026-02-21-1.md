# 2026-02-21-1

- **Date**: 2026-02-21
- **Title**: Initialized PROGRESS workflow and progress-tracker skill
- **Background / Issue**: A process was required to record significant changes and blockers, then synchronize AGENTS and skills documentation.
- **Actions / Outcome**: Added PROGRESS tracking, introduced `progress-tracker`, and documented the workflow in AGENTS.
- **Lessons / Refinements**: When workflow rules change, update governance docs and tracking structures first.
- **Related commit**: `7f660f280105cbeec800d15bb01cb5416c9c217a`
