# 2026-02-22-1

- **Date**: 2026-02-22
- **Title**: Migrated PROGRESS to `.agents/` structured entries
- **Background / Issue**: `PROGRESS.md` in the repo root would keep growing and increase context overhead.
- **Actions / Outcome**: Moved progress governance to `.agents/PROGRESS.md`, introduced per-entry files under `.agents/progress/entries/YYYY/`, migrated existing records, and updated AGENTS plus `progress-tracker` references.
- **Lessons / Refinements**: Keep long-running process logs split by entry files and indexed centrally to control context size.
